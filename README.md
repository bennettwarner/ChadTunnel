## GETTING RIPPED ON SSH GAINS
Needing that dynamic tunnel rush? Need some of that pure service over ssh?
Ain't got time for that nerdy "kOmMaNd lInE Is fOr tRuE PoWeR UsErS" CRAP?
Then you need this ChadTunnel, so F'in HARD!!!

Seriously though, what does it do? 
It simplifies creating ssh tunnels, specifically:
1. Dynamic tunnels which pipe all info through a host
2. Bring a remote service through a host
3. Set up a tunnel that will traverse through an infinite number of jump boxes

## Install

```sh
go get github.com/bennettwarner/ChadTunnel
```

Or download and run the pre-compiled binaries.

## Usage

```sh
go run main.go
```

Binaries are provided for Windows but untested...
