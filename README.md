## GETTING RIPPED ON SSH GAINS
Needing that dynamic tunnel rush? Need some of that pure service over ssh?
Ain't got time for that nerdy "kOmMaNd lInE?
Then you need this ChadTunnel!!!

Seriously though, what does it do? 
It simplifies all the ssh commands that are hard to remember, specifically:
1. Dynamic tunnels to proxy traffic through a host (and optionally a jumpbox)
2. Forward ports from a remote service to a host (and optionally a jumpbox)
3. Set up a SSH session that will traverse through a jump box

## Install

```sh
go install github.com/bennettwarner/ChadTunnel@latest
```

Or download and run the pre-compiled binaries.

## Usage

```sh
go run main.go
```

Binaries are provided for Windows but untested...
